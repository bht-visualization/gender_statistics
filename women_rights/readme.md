# Women's Rights and Gender Equality Around the World - Project Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to the project "Women's Rights and Gender Equality Around the World." This project is part of my individual assignment for the data visualization course in the Master of Data Science program. The objective of this project is to explore and compare the situation of women's rights and gender equality across various regions and countries worldwide.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize key indicators related to women's rights and gender equality using data from the World Bank's Gender Statistics database. By examining a range of factors, we aim to gain insights into how different regions and countries have progressed in terms of gender equality over the years.

## Data Source

To conduct this analysis, I utilized the data available from the World Bank's Gender Statistics database, which can be accessed at 'https://databank.worldbank.org/source/gender-statistics'. This dataset provides valuable information on various socio-economic indicators related to gender, such as population totals, employment ratios, labor force participation, employment quality, life quality, and the Women Business and the Law Index Score.

## Methodology and Tools

For the analysis and visualization, I utilized Python along with Plotly and Dash libraries. These powerful tools enable us to create interactive and insightful visualizations to better understand the patterns and trends in gender-related data. The geopy library allowed us to work with geographic data, and geopandas was used to handle geographical mapping.

## Project Scope

The project focuses on six major regions of the world, namely:

1. Europe
2. Middle East
3. Asia
4. Africa
5. South America
6. North and Middle America

Within each of these regions, we selected ten countries to analyze in detail. The chosen countries are as follows:

- Europe: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland
- Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Islamic Rep., Israel, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Lebanon, Qatar, Jordan, Kuwait
- Asia: China, Japan, India, Vietnam, Russian Federation, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Malaysia
- Africa: Egypt, Arab Rep., South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Algeria, Ghana, Uganda
- South America: Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, RB, Uruguay, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Guyana, Suriname, Ecuador
- North and Middle America: United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Dominican Republic



## Let's Begin!

With the groundwork set, we are now ready to delve into the fascinating world of gender equality and women's rights. Let's explore the data and discover insights that shed light on the progress and challenges faced by women in different parts of the world. The subsequent sections will present a detailed analysis of each region and country, accompanied by visualizations to enhance the overall understanding of the subject matter.
